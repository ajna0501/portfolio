### Solar Pannel Detection - Machine Learning

For my Machine learning course at Uni, two of my teammates and I developed a model that detects solar panels from sattellite images. We had several apporaches :
- Random forest model _accuracy 0.53_
- KNN model, _accuracy 0.5_
- Nerual Network, _accuracy 0.95_
Nerual network model showed promising results and was our final model for this research
